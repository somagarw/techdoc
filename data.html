        <p>
          JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language.
          Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its
          environment to provide programmatic control over them. </p>

        <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language
          elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety
          of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its
            Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on
            an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
          </li>
          <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a
            server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide
            continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations
            on a server.
          </li>

        <ul>
          <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).

          </li>
          <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).

          </li>
          <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main
            page about JavaScript.

        <p>
          JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript
          language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows
          most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it
          was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.

        </p>

        <p>
          In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime
          system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has
          a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model
          provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also
          supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects,
          executing as loosely typed methods.

        </p>

        <p>
          JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes,
          and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you
          do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly
          typed.
